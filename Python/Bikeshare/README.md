## Project Title
US Bikeshare

## Description & story
This project marks my first venture into Python scripting and served as my final project during the Udacity Nanodegree. The objectives were to use Python for data exploration, answer statistical questions through calculations, and build an interactive environment where users can choose and filter data.

Bikeshare systems allow users to rent bikes for a reasonable fee, picking up a bike at one station and returning it to another station within the same system. While Bikeshare programs have expanded widely over the years, this project focuses on data from three cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington.

## Data
- chicago.csv 
- new_york_city.csv 
- washington.csv  

Note: The 'Gender' and 'Birth Year' data are not available in the Washington dataset.
