## Project Title 
Jobs and Salaries in Data 

## Description
This analysis examines salaries and employment trends in various data-related roles between 2020 and 2023. It compares employment types (full-time, part-time), employment levels (junior, senior), and job categories (data engineering, data analysis). Median salary was used as the baseline for comparison, incorporating minimum salary figures to mitigate the impact of outliers. All salaries were converted to USD to facilitate analysis.

## Data 
The dataset is sourced from a CSV file titled "Jobs and Salaries in Data," downloaded from Kaggle.com.

## Conclusion
By 2023, the median salary for data roles increased by 69%. Over the years, the option to work in a hybrid model has decreased, with 67% of employees working in-person, 32% working remotely, and only 1% working in a hybrid model. Machine Learning and AI have emerged as the most popular job categories in the data field.
